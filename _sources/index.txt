   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

youBot-py (Under Development)
=====================================

This wrapper is intended for those who want to try pthon as a stand-alone language to work on youBot:

- The youbot-py is a pure python wrapper for the youbot_driver.
- Protoytping and a scripting layer has become an inevitable entity. 
- Developing a python wrapper for youBot with out any dependency of framework was the aim of this wrapper.
- For issues or bug report, please raise a ticket to hotline@youbot-store.com

   :maxdepth: 3
	

Installation
==================

Please follow the below installation instructions:

* Compile `youbot_driver`_ and set the environment variables. ROS framework is not required.
		
		- Make sure that you change *path_to_youbot_driver* in the below to your current driver path.
                - echo "source export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/*path_to_youbot_driver*/lib/" >> ~/.bashrc
                - echo "export YOUBOT_HOME=/*path_to_youbot_driver*" >> ~/.bashrc
		- source ~/.bashrc 

Building and Installing the wrapper:

* Build and Install.

                - git clone https://github.com/praman2s/youbot-py.git
                - cd youbot-py
                - python setup.py build --build-base=.
                - python setup.py install

Now the wrapper is ready to be tested.

Manual
==================

The whole wrapper is divided into three parts:

- Communication with youbot.
- Getters and Setters for youbot arm.
- Getters and setters for youbot base.

Communication with youbot
*********************************
This sets up the communication between PC and youBot ethercat drivers::

	from youbotpy import *   <-------------- Imports all the modules that are being exposed
	robot = robot()            <-------------Tries to establish connection, if not throws exception
	robot.Calibrate()             <----------Optional. For some users who want candle positon as initial pose.


Getters and Setters for youbot arm
***********************************
The wrapper allows you to work with arm alone. Config files have to altered accordingly::
	
	arm  = robot.GetArm()[0]   <------------- Get the first arm connected.(Support for dual arm as well)
	arm2 = robot.GetArm()[1]   <------------- Get the second arm connected. (throws error if not connected)
	arm.GetJointValues()	     <----------- Returns the current joint value as 5x1 array.
	arm.SetJointValues(value)    <----------- Sets joint values. value should be 5x1 array.
	arm.GetVelocityValues()	     <----------- Returns the current joint velocity as 5x1 array.
	arm.SetVelocityValues(value) <----------- Sets joint velocity values. value should be 5x1 array.
	arm.GetTorqueValues()	     <----------- Returns the current joint torque values as 5x1 array.
	arm.SetTorqueValues(value)    <----------- Sets joint toruque values. value should be 5x1 array.

Getters and Setters for youbot base
************************************

The wrapper allows you to work with base alone. Config files have to altered accordingly::
	
	base = robot.GetBase()  <-------------- Tries to check if the base is connected.
	base.SetVelocity([x,y,theta]) <-------- Sets the base velocity to x,y and theta.
	base.GetVelocity()               <----- Returns a 3x1 (x,y,\theta) velocity vector.

Examples
==================

This is an example file where it takes three lines to get connected to youBot::

	from youbotpy import *   #exposes youbot_driver to python
	import time

	robot = robot()    # Calls the constructor . Important to call at the begining
	robot.Calibrate()  # Sets the robot in candle position and sets encoder to zero
	joint_values = [1,1,1,1,1] # some position that of the arm that the user demands
	robot.SetArmJointValues(joint_values) # sets the joint values
	time.sleep(2)
	current = time.time()

	while (time.time()-current < 5):
		robot.SetBaseVelocity([0.1,0,0]) #Sets the base velocity to x - 0.1 for 5 seconds

	print "End of Hello World..!!!"
