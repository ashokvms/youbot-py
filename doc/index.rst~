Contents:

                - export YOUBOT_HOME=/path_to_youbot_driver

Building and Installing the wrapper:

* Build and Install.

                - git clone https://github.com/praman2s/youbot-py.git

Examples
==================

This is an example file where it takes three lines to get connected to youBot::

	from youbotpy import *   #exposes youbot_driver to python
	import time

	robot = robot()    # Calls the constructor . Important to call at the begining
	robot.Calibrate()  # Sets the robot in candle position and sets encoder to zero
	joint_values = [1,1,1,1,1] # some position that of the arm that the user demands
	robot.SetArmJointValues(joint_values) # sets the joint values
	time.sleep(2)
	current = time.time()

	while (time.time()-current < 5):
		robot.SetBaseVelocity([0.1,0,0]) #Sets the base velocity to x - 0.1 for 5 seconds

	print "End of Hello World..!!!"
